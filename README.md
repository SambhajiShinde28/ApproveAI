# ApproveAI - Loan Prediction App 💳💰  

The Loan Prediction App is a full-stack web application that predicts loan eligibility using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. It analyzes user inputs like income, credit history, and dependents to provide real-time, accurate predictions. Built with React.js for a dynamic frontend and Django for a robust backend, the app securely stores user data and results in a MySQL database. It features an interactive bar chart for visualizing prediction probabilities, offering users clear insights. With a modern tech stack and scalable design, the app is ideal for streamlining loan approvals and is ready for deployment with options for future enhancements.
